I`m in the list of committers of Bitrise project.

Bitrise is mobile Continuous Integration / Continuous Delivery service, which is very easy to set up and maintain workflows.

<div class="iframely-embed"><div class="iframely-responsive" style="height: 168px; padding-bottom: 0;"><a href="https://blog.bitrise.io/were-coming-to-tokyo" data-iframely-url="//cdn.iframe.ly/api/iframe?url=https%3A%2F%2Fblog.bitrise.io%2Fwere-coming-to-tokyo&key=b9fe832f5332a1c3e40cbe51810e08d3"></a></div></div><script async src="//cdn.iframe.ly/embed.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

They are now trying to spread this service in Japan because Japan is now 3rd biggest market.

I have some experience of setting and maintaining Android workflows of Bitrise, therefore I contributed translation of document from English to Japanese.

I`ll continue to contribute document translation as studying English.

In addition, I`ll challenge another contribution such as Steps.
