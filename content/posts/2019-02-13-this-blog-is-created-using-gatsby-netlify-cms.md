I was thinking of creating my own blog.

Using Wordpress is good option, but I want another because I want to study Javascript in addition.

Therefore, I started creating blog using Gatsby and Netlify CMS.

Gatsby is static site generator using React.

<div class="iframely-embed"><div class="iframely-responsive" style="height: 168px; padding-bottom: 0;"><a href="https://www.gatsbyjs.org/" data-iframely-url="//cdn.iframe.ly/api/iframe?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gatsbyjs.org%2F&key=b9fe832f5332a1c3e40cbe51810e08d3"></a></div></div>

It`s based on React, so you can easily customize views using React.

Netlify is static hosting service which has many features such as DNS, CMS and SSL.

<div class="iframely-embed"><div class="iframely-responsive" style="height: 168px; padding-bottom: 0;"><a href="https://www.netlify.com/" data-iframely-url="//cdn.iframe.ly/api/iframe?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.netlify.com%2F&key=b9fe832f5332a1c3e40cbe51810e08d3"></a></div></div>

It`s basically free to use, and I only paid for my domain(tadashi0713.com) and automatically applied to my blog.

It also provides CI / CD support with git hosting service such as GitHub, which is convenient for developers.

With Nelify CMS, you can manage content similar to Wordpress.

<div class="iframely-embed"><div class="iframely-responsive" style="height: 168px; padding-bottom: 0;"><a href="https://github.com/alxshelepenok/gatsby-starter-lumen" data-iframely-url="//cdn.iframe.ly/api/iframe?url=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Falxshelepenok%2Fgatsby-starter-lumen&key=b9fe832f5332a1c3e40cbe51810e08d3"></a></div>

I used this starter with has above features.

Just click `Deploy to netlify`, and Netlify clones repo, build gatsby, and deploy automatically.

I`ll share some tips later.
